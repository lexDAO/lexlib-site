Each quarter 3 people in, 3 people out. 

Term is 6 term, ensure continuity but also distributed decision making

First new group starts in Q3 2022, so everyone in the first group gets their minimum 6 month term, then 3 rotate out each quarter. Multi-sig owners don’t change, but are just executing decisions in short term, maybe convert to The OC also being multi-sig members.

### Leadership Succession Process for Operating Committee (OC), Operator (O), and Assistant Operator (AO)
Anyone can apply for The OC. Only a current member of The OC can apply for O and AO.

All roles go through the full voting process in the Operating System every time, even if only one candidate.

Both the O and AO can be reelected for up to 2 consecutive terms. If after 2 terms for the current O or AO, no new candidates are interested in a role, then the current O and AO can continue. O and AO can run for additional terms in the same role after taking off 2 terms. AO can do 4 consecutive terms if they do 2 terms as AO then 2 terms as O.

Ideally this is done by soft consensus, not a campaign, everyone who wants and contributes will get their chance.

## Criteria for OC, O, AO:
- LexDAO member for at least 6 months before term starts.
- Earned at least one CRED for contributions to LexDAO.
- Pick people who have been most involved in the DAO to reward them and pay them.
- To become the AO or O, you must be a current member of The OC.

## Continuity
- If AO is next O or either the AO or O is remaining in their role, then continuity is easier, if not, then O and AO have to train their replacements and be there for ongoing questions.
- The O and AO should stay on The OC for at least one quarter after their roles end.
- For each role, candidate must respond to these questions in this form in writing and take questions from members at both Governance Meetings:
  - Legal education and license
  Background including operations, legal, LexDAO, CREDs earned, web3 experience (<500 characters)
- In applying, you affirm that you have read the OS and will fulfill the responsibilities of the role
- Around the 1st day of the month before the transition, O and AO make an open call for candidates for all roles.
- O and AO award CREDs for contributions each quarter.

## Working Group (WG) Leads

### New Leadership Process
- 6-month term
- WG group lead leads the process to replace themselves, they can tweak the process as needed

### Call for candidates
- Candidates post a summary of who they are and why they want the role

9 OC keeps permissions for now, Operator and AO keep permissions for now

## Monthly Checklist
