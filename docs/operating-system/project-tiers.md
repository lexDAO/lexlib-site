# Project Tiers

## Tier 1: Minor & Incubator
For smaller projects, working groups, and early stage projects 

Any Tier 2 Certified Member can launch a Tier 1 Project, no approval, and get a Discord channel.

## Tier 2: Major
Tier 2 Projects are the bigger initiatives LexDAO is working on.

How to propose a new Tier 2 project:

Answer the question listed below, then follow the process for any voting decision.

1. Mission: Why are we doing this project? How does it fit the DAO Goals?
2. Long-Term Goals: What is this project trying to accomplish?

Probably short-term goals too, but that’s up to the project team

## Team
Project Owner, at least, as a go-to point of contact
Who are you? What have you done for LexDAO? What CREDs have you earned?

List of other members and roles is recommended, including opportunities for new members to get involved and junior members to learn

## Budget
Source of startup and long-term funding
Grant, revenue, fundraising
Request for funds from DAO, and how/if the DAO and/or the world will be repaid for that
Rough spreadsheet of the money coming in and going out, with where it’s going

## Revenue or Grant Distribution Plan

1. If the Project will receive revenue, grants, investments, or other kinds of funding of any kind, then include the distribution plan:
    - 10% of all incoming funds of any kind and 10% of tokens to LexDAO treasury for brand, DAOops, and other support
    - Each project decides where the other 90% goes
    10% LexDAO, 20% Tier 2 Project Team, 70% Implementation Team might make sense in some cases (LexEd)
2. Referral / sourcing / finder fees
3. Compensation, financials, loot
    - Crypto account, with multi-sig capabilities and list of signers, every Tier 2 Project that will use funds in any way should have its own account, maybe under a parent account
4. Legal structure: Part of UNA? Part of LLC? Series LLC? Separate LLC? Non-US entity like Cayman Foundation?

## Project Plan example

1. How will you communicate?
Tier 2 project owner decides on what discord channels to have and who is in the discord channels, can be whoever they want

Need a google group for calendar invitations, permissioned google docs, and email? Create it under lexdaocoop@gmail.com

2. How will you share information?
Need a google drive folder? Create it under lexdaocoop@gmail.com
