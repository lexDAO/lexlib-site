# Introduction

## Why have an Operating System? 

### Efficiency 
Rules and documentation let the org run itself (dAo = Autonomous), as much as possible.

### Empowerment, Autonomy, and Happiness
Give people the guidelines on how to work within the LexDAO system so they can be empowered to launch and run projects.

### Value 
Efficiency + Empowerment = Value Creation

### Consistency and Fairness
Without rules, the loudest voices, the sharpest elbows, the most entitled people win. Letâ€™s ensure the people who add the most value and act consistently with our good people culture are the winners.
Lots of other ways to say it. Read more if you love operations as much as certain people do.


## Operating Principles
Owners of everything. Tag the owner with relevant items in discord. Give them ideas and feedback, empower them to act on it.
Use systems, rules, and documentation to empower people to know how to propose and run projects.
